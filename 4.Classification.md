1. A table below shows a sample dataset of whether a customer responds to the survey or not. “Outcome” is a class label. Construct a Decision tree classifier for the dataset. For a new example ( Rural, semidetached, low, No)  what will be the predicted class.

![Table 4.1](/Images/Table_4.1.png)

2. Brifly explain Bagging and Boosting of the Classfiers


3. Define Classification, Issues of Classification and Explain ID3 classfication with example.


4. Explain different methods that can be used to evaluate and compare accuracy of different classfication algorthms.


5. Use any classification techniques and find out the class of (Homeowner = Yes, Status = Employed , Income = Average)

ID,Homeowner,Status,Income, Defaulted
1,Yes,Employed,High,No,
2,No,Business,Average,NO
3,No,Employed,Low,No
4,Yes,Business,High,No
5,No,Unemployed,Average,Yes
6,No,Business,Low,No
7,Yes,Unemployed,High,No
8,No,Employed,Average,Yes
9,No,Business,Low,No
10,No,Employed,Average,Yes



6. Navie Based Classifier
Naïve Bayes classifiers are a family of simple probabilistic classifiers which assume that the effect of an attribute value on a given class is independent of the values of the other attributes. This assumption is called class conditional independence. It is made to simplify the computations involved and, in this sense, is considered “naïve”. In simple terms, a Naive Bayes classifier assumes that the presence of a particular feature in a class is unrelated to the presence of any other feature.
